# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Module  

## 1. Overview of RAG  

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates retrieval mechanisms with generative models to produce context-aware responses by accessing external knowledge dynamically. This architecture is highly modular, allowing for customization and optimization based on task requirements. 

A typical RAG pipeline involves:
- **Retriever**: Fetches relevant documents.
- **Chunker**: Splits documents for efficient retrieval.
- **Generator**: Generates responses based on retrieved context.
- **Orchestrator**: Manages interactions between these components.


## 2. Types of RAG Architectures  

The architecture of a RAG system defines how components are organized and interact. Below are the most common RAG architectures:

### 2.1 Naive RAG  
The simplest architecture where the query is sent to a retriever, and the retrieved chunks are passed directly to the generator for response generation.  
- **Advantages**: Easy to implement, low complexity.  
- **Use Cases**: General-purpose question answering, quick prototypes.  


### 2.2 Retrieve-and-Rerank RAG  
Enhances the naive architecture by incorporating a reranker to prioritize retrieved results.  
- **Components**: Retriever, reranker, generator.  
- **Advantages**: Improves relevance and precision of retrieved context.  
- **Use Cases**: Customer support systems, legal document search.  


### 2.3 Multimodal RAG  
Combines text and visual inputs for tasks that require multimodal reasoning. The retriever handles multimodal datasets, and the generator processes both text and image contexts.  
- **Components**: Multimodal retriever, image encoder, text generator.  
- **Use Cases**: Visual question answering, image captioning, multimodal search.  


### 2.4 Graph RAG  
Leverages graph databases or graph neural networks (GNNs) to model relationships between entities and retrieve structured knowledge.  
- **Components**: Graph retriever, node representation model, generator.  
- **Advantages**: Ideal for reasoning over structured data like knowledge graphs.  
- **Use Cases**: Scientific research, complex entity reasoning, technical documentation.  


### 2.5 Hybrid RAG  
Combines multiple retrieval mechanisms, such as dense vector search and keyword-based search, to ensure robust and diverse retrieval.  
- **Components**: Multi-retriever setup, generator.  
- **Advantages**: Balances precision and recall by integrating complementary retrieval methods.  
- **Use Cases**: Multilingual search, domain-specific retrieval.  


### 2.6 Agentic RAG (Router)  
Uses an agent-based approach to route queries to specialized retrievers or tools based on query type.  
- **Components**: Router agent, multiple retrievers, generator.  
- **Advantages**: Scalable and adaptable to different query types.  
- **Use Cases**: Customer support with diverse query domains.  


### 2.7 Agentic RAG (Multi-Agent RAG)  
Extends the router architecture by involving multiple agents that interact dynamically to solve tasks collaboratively.  
- **Components**: Multiple agents, retrievers, external tools (e.g., Slack, Gmail), generator.  
- **Advantages**: Flexible and supports integration with external systems.  
- **Use Cases**: Workflow automation, enterprise search systems.
