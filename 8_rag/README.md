# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Module  

## 1. Overview of RAG  

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and generation. However, their reliance on static training data presents significant challenges. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these limitations by combining dynamic retrieval with generative capabilities.  

### Why RAG is Needed  

- **Reducing Hallucination**  
RAG grounds responses in external knowledge, ensuring accuracy by dynamically fetching relevant context instead of relying solely on static, memorized information.

- **Real-Time Knowledge**  
Unlike static models, RAG can integrate live data, making it ideal for fast-changing domains like finance, news, and research.

- **Automation and Scalability**  
RAG simplifies complex workflows by dynamically accessing and integrating diverse information sources, enabling scalable applications such as customer support, enterprise search, and workflow automation.

- **Domain-Specific Adaptability**  
With tailored retrievers and modular design, RAG excels in specialized applications such as legal, healthcare, or education, offering flexibility and precision.

- **Cost Efficiency**  
By offloading retrieval tasks to external systems, RAG reduces computational costs and eliminates the need for frequent model fine-tuning.

### RAG Architecture  

RAG's modular architecture allows for customization and optimization based on task requirements. A typical RAG pipeline involves the following components:  
- **Retriever**: Fetches relevant documents or chunks of information.  
- **Chunker**: Splits documents into manageable segments for efficient retrieval.  
- **Generator**: Generates responses using the retrieved context.  
- **Orchestrator**: Manages interactions between these components to ensure seamless workflow.  


## 2. Types of RAG Architectures  

The architecture of a RAG system defines how components are organized and interact. Below are the most common RAG architectures:

### 2.1 Naive RAG  
The simplest architecture where the query is sent to a retriever, and the retrieved chunks are passed directly to the generator for response generation.  
- **Advantages**: Easy to implement, low complexity.  
- **Use Cases**: General-purpose question answering, quick prototypes.  


### 2.2 Retrieve-and-Rerank RAG  
Enhances the naive architecture by incorporating a reranker to prioritize retrieved results.  
- **Components**: Retriever, reranker, generator.  
- **Advantages**: Improves relevance and precision of retrieved context.  
- **Use Cases**: Customer support systems, legal document search.  


### 2.3 Multimodal RAG  
Combines text and visual inputs for tasks that require multimodal reasoning. The retriever handles multimodal datasets, and the generator processes both text and image contexts.  
- **Components**: Multimodal retriever, image encoder, text generator.  
- **Use Cases**: Visual question answering, image captioning, multimodal search.  


### 2.4 Graph RAG  
Leverages graph databases or graph neural networks (GNNs) to model relationships between entities and retrieve structured knowledge.  
- **Components**: Graph retriever, node representation model, generator.  
- **Advantages**: Ideal for reasoning over structured data like knowledge graphs.  
- **Use Cases**: Scientific research, complex entity reasoning, technical documentation.  


### 2.5 Hybrid RAG  
Combines multiple retrieval mechanisms, such as dense vector search and keyword-based search, to ensure robust and diverse retrieval.  
- **Components**: Multi-retriever setup, generator.  
- **Advantages**: Balances precision and recall by integrating complementary retrieval methods.  
- **Use Cases**: Multilingual search, domain-specific retrieval.  


### 2.6 Agentic RAG (Router)  
Uses an agent-based approach to route queries to specialized retrievers or tools based on query type.  
- **Components**: Router agent, multiple retrievers, generator.  
- **Advantages**: Scalable and adaptable to different query types.  
- **Use Cases**: Customer support with diverse query domains.  


### 2.7 Agentic RAG (Multi-Agent RAG)  
Extends the router architecture by involving multiple agents that interact dynamically to solve tasks collaboratively.  
- **Components**: Multiple agents, retrievers, external tools (e.g., Slack, Gmail), generator.  
- **Advantages**: Flexible and supports integration with external systems.  
- **Use Cases**: Workflow automation, enterprise search systems.  


## 3. Components of RAG  

### 3.1 Retriever  
Handles fetching of relevant documents or information from a knowledge base. Popular frameworks include:
- **Vector Databases**: Tools like **Qdrant**, **Weaviate**, and **Pinecone**.
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines keyword and vector search.


### 3.2 Chunker  
Splits documents into smaller chunks for effective retrieval. Tools like **LangChain Text Splitters** are commonly used.


### 3.3 Generator  
Generates responses by processing the retrieved context.  
- **Options**: GPT models, multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4 Vision).  

In this course we will use the Smol-family models as generator.

### 3.4 Orchestrator  
Manages interaction between components and workflows.  
- **Tools**: **LangChain**, **HayStack**.  


## 4. Evaluation  

Evaluation involves measuring retrieval quality and response generation accuracy.  
- **Frameworks**: **RAGAs** for integrated evaluation, **BLEU**, **ROUGE**, and **MRR** for detailed metrics.
